Mathematics is often described as the language of the universe, and within this vast language, elliptic curves and modular forms hold a special place. These two seemingly abstract concepts have deep and surprising connections to number theory, cryptography, and even the proof of some of the most famous conjectures in mathematics. In this blog post, we'll dive into the intriguing realms of elliptic curves and modular forms, exploring their definitions, properties, and the profound link between them.
