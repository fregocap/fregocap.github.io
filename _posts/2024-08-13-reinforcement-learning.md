In this blog post, we are going to talk about Markov Decision Process (MDP). MDPs are very important in the context of reinforcement learning (RL), because lots of RL problems can be put into some form or another as MDPs. For example, the bandit problem, which is a typical RL problem, is actually an MDP with one state. One can also have MDPs with a full observable environment (e.g. chess) or with partially observable environment (financial market).
