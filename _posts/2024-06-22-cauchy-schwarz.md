Inner product spaces play a crucial role in various fields such as linear algebra, quantum mechanics and more. One of the key results in these spaces is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. This blog post explores this inequality and demonstrates its proof using the so-called amplification method. 

## Inner Product Spaces 

An inner product space is a vector space equipped with an additional structure called an inner product. This inner product allows for the measurement of angles and lengths within the space.
