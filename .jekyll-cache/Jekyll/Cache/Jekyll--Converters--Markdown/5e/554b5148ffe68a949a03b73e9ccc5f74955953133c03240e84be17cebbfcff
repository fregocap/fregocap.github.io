      <p>We consider the generalized laws of thermodynamics in massive gravity. Making use of explicit black hole solutions, we devise black hole merger processes in which i) total entropy of the system decreases ii) the zero-temperature extremal black hole is created. Thus, both second and third laws of thermodynamics are violated. In both cases, the violation can be traced back to the presence of negative-mass black holes, which, in turn, is related to the violation of the null energy condition. The violation of the third law of thermodynamics implies, in particular, that a naked singularity may be created as a result of the evolution of a singularity-free state. This may signal a problem in the model, unless the creation of the negative-mass black holes from positive-mass states can be forbidden dynamically or the naked singularity may somehow be resolved in a full quantum theory.</p>

      <p>The thermodynamic properties of a static and spherically symmetric hairy black hole solution arising in massive gravity with spontaneous Lorentz breaking are investigated. The analysis is carried out by enclosing the black hole in a spherical cavity whose surface is maintained at a fixed temperature T. It turns out that the ensemble is well-defined only if the "hair" parameter Q characterizing the solution is conserved. Under this condition we compute some relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the thermal energy and entropy, and we study the stability and phase structure of the ensemble. In particular, for negative values of the hair parameter, the phase structure is isomorphic to the one of Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in the canonical ensemble. Moreover, the phase-diagram in the plan (Q,T) has a line of first-order phase transition that at a critical value of Q terminates in a second-order phase transition. Below this line the dominant phase consists of small, cold black holes that are long-lived and may thus contribute much more to the energy density of the Universe than what is observationally allowed for radiating black holes. </p>

      <p>We investigate constraints on primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter candidates that arise from their capture by neutron stars (NSs). If a PBH is captured by a NS, the star is accreted onto the PBH and gets destroyed in a very short time. Thus, mere observations of NSs put limits on the abundance of PBHs. High DM densities and low velocities are required to constrain the fraction of PBHs in DM. Such conditions may be realized in the cores of globular clusters if the latter are of a primordial origin. Assuming that cores of globular clusters possess the DM densities exceeding several hundred GeV/cm3 would imply that PBHs are excluded as comprising all of the dark matter in the mass range 3√ó1018g‚â≤mBH‚â≤1024g. At the DM density of 2√ó103 GeV/cm3 that has been found in simulations in the corresponding models, less than 5% of the DM may consist of PBH for these PBH masses. </p>

      <p>By considering adiabatic contraction of the dark matter (DM) during star formation, we estimate the amount of DM trapped in stars at their birth. If the DM consists partly of primordial black holes (PBHs), they will be trapped together with the rest of the DM and will be finally inherited by a star compact remnant ‚Äî a white dwarf (WD) or a neutron star (NS), which they will destroy in a short time. Observations of WDs and NSs thus impose constraints on the abundance of PBH. We show that the best constraints come from WDs and NSs in globular clusters which exclude the DM consisting entirely of PBH in the mass range 1016g‚àí3√ó1022g, with the strongest constraint on the fraction Œ©PBH/Œ©DM‚â≤10‚àí2 being in the range of PBH masses 1017g‚àí1018 g. </p>

      <p>We simulate the adiabatic contraction of a dark matter (DM) distribution during the process of the star formation, paying particular attention to the phase space distribution of the DM particles after the contraction. Assuming the initial uniform density and Maxwellian distribution of DM velocities, we find that the number n(r) of DM particles within the radius r scales like n(r)‚àùr1.5, leading to the DM density profile œÅ‚àùr‚àí1.5, in agreement with the Liouville theorem and previous numerical studies. At the same time, the number of DM particles ŒΩ(r) with periastra smaller than r is parametrically larger, ŒΩ(r)‚àùr, implying that many particles contributing at any given moment into the density œÅ(r) at small r have very elongated orbits and spend most of their time at distances larger than r. This has implications for the capture of DM by stars in the process of their formation. As a concrete example we consider the case of primordial black holes (PBH). We show that accounting for very eccentric orbits boosts the amount of captured PBH by a factor of up to 2√ó103 depending on the PBH mass, improving correspondingly the previously derived constraints on the PBH abundance.</p>

      <p>At large scales and for sufficiently early times, dark matter is described as a pressureless perfect fluid‚Äîdust‚Äînon-interacting with Standard Model fields. These features are captured by a simple model with two scalars: a Lagrange multiplier and another playing the role of the velocity potential. That model arises naturally in some gravitational frameworks, e.g., the mimetic dark matter scenario. We consider an extension of the model by means of higher derivative terms, such that the dust solutions are preserved at the background level, but there is a non-zero sound speed at the linear level. We associate this \it Modified Dust with dark matter, and study the linear evolution of cosmological perturbations in that picture. The most prominent effect is the suppression of their power spectrum for sufficiently large cosmological momenta. This can be relevant in view of the problems that cold dark matter faces at sub-galactic scales, e.g., the missing satellites problem. At even shorter scales, however, perturbations of Modified Dust are enhanced compared to the predictions of more common particle dark matter scenarios. This is a peculiarity of their evolution in radiation dominated background. We also briefly discuss clustering of Modified Dust. We write the system of equations in the Newtonian limit, and sketch the possible mechanism which could prevent the appearance of caustic singularities. The same mechanism may be relevant in light of the core-cusp problem.</p>
