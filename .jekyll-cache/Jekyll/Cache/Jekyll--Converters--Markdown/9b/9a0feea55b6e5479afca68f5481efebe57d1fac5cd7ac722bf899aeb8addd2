I"ü<p>My name is Fabio Capela. I am senior data scientist at Firmenich, where I 
develop advanced machine learning algorithms related to fragrance and flavor 
creation. Prior to Firmenich, Iâ€™ve worked in several sectors such as in 
banking, agriculture, architecture or software engineering. I have a PhD in 
theoretical physics (specialized in black hole physics) and it is still
nowadays one of the subjects that I do dwelve into.</p>

<p>My research interests are broad. That is why I might talk about very 
different subjects in my blog, such as Lie groups, Riemannian geometry or deep 
diffusion models for image synthesis. Whatâ€™s quite outstanding is that even 
though all of those subjects seem to be rather distant, they have a lot of 
common ground.</p>
