I"`<p>My name is Fabio Capela. I am senior data scientist at Firmenich, where I 
develop advanced machine learning algorithms related to fragrance and flavor 
creation. Prior to Firmenich, I’ve worked in several sectors such as in 
banking, agriculture, architecture or software engineering. I have a PhD in 
theoretical physics (specialized in black hole physics** and have been 
applying my mathematical modelling skills to all of those sectors.</p>

<p>My research interests are broad. That is why I might talk about very 
different subjects in my blog, such as Lie groups, Riemannian geometry or deep 
diffusion models for image synthesis. What’s quite outstanding is that even 
though all of those subjects seem to be rather distant, they can be used to help
each other reach deeper truths about the world surrounding us.</p>
