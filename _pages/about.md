<p>Hi there! I'm Fabio, a passionate data scientist with a love for turning complex data into actionable insights. Currently, I work on innovative projects as a Senior Strategist at LDC in Geneva, where I design and implement advanced quantitative trading strategies. My journey in data science has been quite an adventure, from developing AI-driven flavors at Firmenich SA to co-founding SamurAI, where we built cutting-edge sentiment analysis tools.

Outside of work, I'm an avid triathlete, always chasing the next challenge. Whether it's swimming, biking, or running, I find great joy in pushing my physical limits. When I'm not training, you'll often find me spending quality time with my family, which is incredibly important to me.</p>

My academic background is rooted in theoretical physics, with a PhD from ULB in Brussels. This foundation fuels my enthusiasm for mathematics and physics, constantly driving me to explore and innovate in the field of data science.

In addition to my professional and athletic pursuits, I have a deep interest in philosophy. I enjoy reading and contemplating philosophical texts, finding that they provide a rich perspective that complements my scientific endeavors.
