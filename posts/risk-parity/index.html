        <h2 id="what-is-risk-parity-">What is risk parity ?</h2>
<p>There are different sorts of investors: the ones that like to take more risks than the market in exchange of a higher premium and  the ones that are risk averse and  prefer steady returns. Irrespective of your choices of risk, a large portion of  investors would like to optimize their returns with respect to the risks taken. But how to be sure that we are maximizing the Sharpe ratio of our portfolio, i.e. the ratio between return and risk ?</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little secret: you can reach much higher returns than the market for a particular risk level, by providing the same level of risk to parts of your portfolio that are uncorrelated. What do I mean ? What we would like to have is each asset contributing in the same way to the overall portfolio volatility. To go a bit more into detail, let's define the volatility of the portfolio as :</p>
<p>$$
\sigma(w) = \sqrt{w^{T}\Sigma w}
$$</p>
<p>where \(w\) are the weight contributions of each asset to the overall portfolio and \(\Sigma\) is the covariance matrix of the portfolio. The risk contribution of asset \(i\) is computed as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\sigma_i(w) = w_i \times \partial_{w_i}\sigma(w).
$$</p>
<p>You can then show that:</p>
<p>$$
\sigma(w) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i(w)
$$</p>
<p>Marginal contributions come from:</p>
<p>$$
c(w) = \frac{\Sigma w}{\sqrt{w&rsquo;\Sigma w}}.
$$</p>
<p>Once we have defined all the atomic elements, it is pretty easy to understand that the solution is found by running an optimization:</p>
<p>$$
\underset{w}{\mathrm{argmin}} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[\frac{\sqrt{w^T\Sigma w}}{N} - w_i \cdot c(w)_i \right]^2
$$</p>
<p>This is how we would define risk parity mathematically.</p>
<h2 id="diversification-is-key">Diversification is key</h2>
<p>Having a risk parity portfolio is part of the equation, but you also need to consider the assets that you put into your portfolio.
The main key here is diversification: you have to consider assets that are not fully correlated between them such that, if there is a big
drop in one part of your portfolio, say equities, the other parts do not suffer as much.</p>
<p>The formula to understand diversification goes as follows :</p>
<p>$$
\sigma_p^2 = \sum_i^2 \sigma_i^2 + \sum_i \sum_{j} w_i w_j \sigma_i \sigma_j \rho_{ij}
$$</p>
<p>The correlation between the different assets is represented through \(\rho\). Let's try to understand this equation with two assets.
What it says is that if we have two assets with a 80/20 allocation, then the risk of your portfolio is not the sum of the contributions
from each asset. The third term in the equation makes all the difference. Imagine now that your two assets are anticorrelated, which
leads to a negative \(\rho\). Then, the overall risk of your portfolio is lower than the risk contribution of both assets. Amazing!</p>
<p>Of course, in practice, that seems easy. However, in reality it is not. For example, equities globally tend to become highly correlated during
crisis. However, if each element of your portfolio corresponds to an asset class, then there is chances you might get assets that do not correlate
with equities broadly. One of those assets are bonds. They tend to be lower in risk than equities, but are also considered a safe heaven during
major market crashes. Therefore bonds should be considered a diversification factor.</p>
<p>Another asset that might play a role is gold. During inflationary periods, bonds tend to lose money as they go with the inverse of the yield
curve. However, gold  does increase with inflation (one of its few advantages). Therefore, we should typically also consider gold in our portfolio.
That is particularly relevant nowadays as inflationary expectations are growing.
Other assets include real estate indexes, commodities and equities.</p>
<p>To construct your risk parity portfolio, you just have to put those assets into the optimizer previously discussed and you should be good to go.</p>
<h2 id="why-risk-parity">Why risk parity</h2>
<p>Several papers have shown that risk parity is rather close to the tangency portfolio, which is the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio possible based
on the capital asset pricing model. This is under the assumption that the Sharpe ratio of the different assets constituting the risk parity portfolio are similar.</p>
<p>We will continue to explore risk parity portfolio as we do believe to be a really good strategy to follow up.</p>
